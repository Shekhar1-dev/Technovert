The output of the code is:-
array 1: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
array 2: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s

Beacuse first spilt method spilt arr1 varible
then reverse method reverse it and store it in
arr2. arr3 varible is also spilited and stored,
After that we pushed arr3 in arr2. and conclude 
the length of the array. Since The slice() method selects 
from a given start It is doing so.
